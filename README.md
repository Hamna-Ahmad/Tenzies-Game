# Tenzies-game
Tenzies is a simple dice game implemented as a React application. The objective of the game is to roll the dice until all of them show the same value. You can freeze a die at its current value by clicking on it, allowing you to keep certain dice and roll the others. The game keeps track of the number of rolls and the time elapsed.

## Features
- Roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
- Click on a die to freeze it at its current value.
- If all dice are frozen and show the same value, you win the game.
- The game displays the number of rolls taken and the time elapsed.
- Click the "New Game" button to start a new game.
